### Unit 2: Sound / Audio System (6 Hours)

#### **2.1 Concepts of Sound System**
A sound system refers to the equipment and technology used to produce, amplify, and modify sound. The basic concepts behind sound systems include how sound is generated, captured, and reproduced.

- **Sound as a Physical Phenomenon:** Sound is a mechanical wave that requires a medium (air, water, or solid objects) to travel. It is caused by vibrations of objects that create pressure waves in the medium.
- **Sound Waves:** Sound waves consist of compressions (high pressure) and rarefactions (low pressure) that travel through the medium.
- **Propagation:** Sound waves propagate through a medium by transferring kinetic energy between particles.

#### **a. Frequency and Amplitude**
- **Frequency (Pitch):** The frequency of a sound wave is the number of vibrations (or cycles) that occur per second. It is measured in Hertz (Hz). 
  - **Higher frequency** results in a **higher pitch** (e.g., a whistle).
  - **Lower frequency** results in a **lower pitch** (e.g., a drum beat).

- **Amplitude (Loudness):** Amplitude refers to the size of the vibration or the displacement of particles in the medium. It is directly related to the loudness of the sound. The larger the amplitude, the louder the sound.
  - **Greater amplitude** means a **louder sound**.
  - **Smaller amplitude** means a **softer sound**.

#### **b. Computer Representation of Sound**
Digital sound is represented in a way that computers can process, store, and reproduce. This process involves converting analog sound (continuous signals) into digital form (discrete signals).

- **Analog vs. Digital Sound:** 
  - **Analog Sound** is continuous, meaning that it can take any value at any given moment.
  - **Digital Sound** is represented as a sequence of discrete samples taken from the continuous analog sound.

- **Sound Waveforms:** Digital sound can be represented as a waveform on a graph, where the x-axis represents time and the y-axis represents the amplitude of the sound wave at any given time.

#### **c. Sampling Rate**
The sampling rate (or sampling frequency) refers to the number of samples taken from an analog signal per second. It is measured in Hertz (Hz).

- **Higher Sampling Rate:** A higher sampling rate captures more details of the sound wave, resulting in better sound quality.
  - Common audio sampling rates include **44.1 kHz** (used for CDs), **48 kHz** (used in film production), and **96 kHz** (used in high-resolution audio).
- **Nyquist Theorem:** According to the Nyquist theorem, the sampling rate must be at least twice the frequency of the highest frequency in the sound signal to avoid aliasing (distortion).

#### **d. Quantization**
Quantization is the process of mapping the amplitude of the analog signal to a specific set of discrete values. It involves dividing the continuous amplitude range into intervals and assigning a value to each interval.

- **Bit Depth:** The number of bits used to represent each sample is called the bit depth. The greater the bit depth, the more accurately the sound is represented.
  - **8-bit** sound quality is low, with fewer amplitude levels.
  - **16-bit** sound quality is standard for CDs and offers 65,536 levels.
  - **24-bit** sound provides 16.7 million levels and is used for professional audio.

#### **e. Sound Hardware**
Sound hardware consists of physical components responsible for capturing, processing, and reproducing sound in a computer system.

- **Microphones (Input Devices):** These devices convert sound waves (mechanical vibrations) into electrical signals, which can be digitized by a sound card.
  - **Dynamic Microphones:** Use electromagnetic induction to convert sound into electrical signals.
  - **Condenser Microphones:** Use a diaphragm and backplate to convert sound into electrical signals.

  - **Dynamic Speakers:** Use an electromagnet to move a diaphragm and create sound.
  - **Piezoelectric Speakers:** Use piezoelectric materials that change shape when an electrical charge is applied, producing sound.

- **Sound Cards:** A sound card is responsible for converting digital signals into analog signals (for output) and analog signals into digital signals (for input).
  - **Internal Sound Cards:** Installed inside the computer and connected to the motherboard.
  - **External Sound Cards:** Connected via USB or other external interfaces and used for better sound quality.

- **Digital Signal Processors (DSP):** DSPs are specialized microprocessors that manipulate digital sound signals to enhance audio quality or apply effects (e.g., reverb, equalization).

- **Amplifiers:** Amplifiers increase the amplitude (volume) of audio signals before sending them to speakers or headphones.

#### **Summary of Key Concepts:**
1. **Sound is a mechanical wave** that requires a medium to travel.
2. **Frequency** determines the pitch of the sound, and **amplitude** determines the loudness.
3. **Digital sound representation** involves converting analog signals into a series of samples using the concepts of **sampling rate** and **quantization**.
4. The **sampling rate** defines how often samples are taken from the sound wave, and **quantization** defines the number of discrete values that can represent the sound.

### 2.2 Music and Speech: MIDI Concepts, Devices, Messages, Timing Standards, and Software

#### **a. Basic MIDI Concepts**
MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) is a technical standard that enables electronic musical instruments, computers, and other devices to communicate and control each other. It allows for the transmission of music performance data, such as note information, timing, and instrument controls, rather than actual audio signals. 

Key concepts:
- **MIDI Data:** MIDI transmits data rather than sound. This data includes information like note on/off, velocity (how hard the note is pressed), pitch, modulation, and many other musical parameters.
- **MIDI Channels:** MIDI uses 16 channels, each of which can control a different instrument or voice. Each channel can carry information for a different part of a musical composition (e.g., a melody, bass line, etc.).
- **MIDI Instruments:** Devices capable of interpreting MIDI data and generating sound. These can be synthesizers, sound modules, or computers.

#### **b. MIDI Devices**
MIDI devices can be broadly categorized into **input** and **output** devices that send and receive MIDI data, respectively.

### 2.3 Speech Generation: Basic Notions, Reproduced Speech Output, Time-Dependent and Frequency-Dependent Sound Concatenation

#### **a. Basic Notions of Speech Generation**
Speech generation is the process of synthesizing human speech through technology, typically using computers. It involves converting written text into spoken words or sounds. The process can be broken down into the following components:

- **Text-to-Speech (TTS) Systems:** These systems convert written text into spoken language. The primary goal is to create speech that sounds natural and intelligible.
- **Speech Synthesis vs. Speech Recognition:**
  - **Speech Synthesis:** Involves generating speech from text (text-to-speech).
  - **Speech Recognition:** Involves converting spoken language into text (speech-to-text).

- **Phonemes and Prosody:**
  - **Phonemes:** The smallest units of sound in a language. A speech generation system must map the text into these phonemes.
  - **Prosody:** Refers to the rhythm, stress, and intonation patterns of speech that give it naturalness and expressiveness. Good TTS systems must replicate prosody to make speech sound more human-like.

#### **b. Reproduced Speech Output**
Reproduced speech output is the final sound produced by a speech synthesis system after it processes the input text. This output is typically generated through one of two main approaches: concatenative synthesis or parametric synthesis.

- **Concatenative Synthesis:** This method involves stitching together segments of prerecorded speech. These segments, or "units," could be phonemes, syllables, words, or phrases.
  - **Advantages:** Produces very natural-sounding speech because it uses real human voices.
  - **Disadvantages:** Requires a large database of recorded speech and may struggle with generating speech in real-time or with high variability.

- **Parametric Synthesis:** This method generates speech using parameters like pitch, duration, and voice quality, typically through a mathematical model. The system does not use prerecorded audio but instead generates speech waveforms from scratch.
  - **Advantages:** More flexible and efficient for real-time applications.
  - **Disadvantages:** The voice quality may not sound as natural as concatenative synthesis.

- **Formant Synthesis:** A type of parametric synthesis that models the vocal tract and speech organs. It is less natural but allows for flexibility in generating a wide range of voices and languages.
  
- **Waveform Synthesis:** A more recent method where an actual waveform of speech is generated by synthesizing the vibrations of vocal cords. This method can produce high-quality, natural speech but is computationally intensive.

#### **c. Time-Dependent Sound Concatenation**
Time-dependent sound concatenation refers to the method of generating speech by piecing together various sound segments that are time-aligned to produce a continuous and coherent speech output.

- **Segmenting Speech:** In concatenative synthesis, speech is typically broken down into small, manageable units such as phonemes, syllables, or even whole words. These units are recorded separately and then concatenated together.
  - **Challenges in Time Alignment:** The main challenge in time-dependent concatenation is ensuring that each segment is properly aligned so the transitions between segments are smooth. This includes managing the natural variability in speech, such as differences in speed and rhythm.
  - **Overlap and Add:** To improve the transition between segments, an overlap-and-add technique may be used, where the ends of adjacent units overlap and are combined to reduce discontinuities.
  
- **Time Stretching and Pitch Shifting:** In some cases, sound units need to be stretched or compressed in time to fit the context of the speech. Time-stretching allows units to be elongated without affecting their pitch, while pitch shifting adjusts the pitch without altering the timing.

- **Coarticulation:** A challenge in time-dependent concatenation arises due to coarticulation, the phenomenon where the articulation of one sound affects the articulation of adjacent sounds. For example, the sound of a vowel will be slightly different depending on the preceding and following consonants. A good TTS system must account for these variations during concatenation.

#### **d. Frequency-Dependent Sound Concatenation**
Frequency-dependent sound concatenation focuses on the frequency characteristics of speech sounds and involves adjusting the frequency components of the sound units when concatenating them. This method emphasizes the timbre, resonance, and spectral characteristics of speech.

- **Spectral Features:** The spectral content of speech refers to the distribution of energy across different frequencies. When concatenating speech units, ensuring that the spectral features match is crucial for achieving a natural sound.
  - **Formant Frequencies:** Formants are resonant frequencies in the vocal tract that shape the sound of speech. Each vowel sound has distinct formant frequencies, which must be matched when concatenating segments.
  - **Pitch and Harmonics:** The pitch of a sound corresponds to the frequency of the vocal fold vibrations, and harmonics are integer multiples of the pitch frequency. Consistent pitch and harmonic alignment across concatenated segments are necessary for natural speech output.
  
- **Frequency Warping:** This technique involves adjusting the frequency spectrum of a sound unit to better match the target unit. It can be used to correct mismatches in timbre or pitch between units and ensure smoother concatenation.

- **Spectral Smoothing:** Spectral smoothing can be applied to make transitions between concatenated segments less noticeable by smoothing out the differences in spectral characteristics. This is essential for avoiding audible artifacts in the final speech output.

- **Frequency Modulation:** This technique modulates the frequency components of a sound, especially when there is a mismatch in frequency between the units. It helps preserve the natural intonation and melody of speech.

#### **e. Challenges in Concatenative Speech Generation**
- **Naturalness:** While concatenative synthesis can produce natural-sounding speech, achieving smooth transitions between concatenated segments is difficult. Variations in prosody, timing, and pitch between segments can make the speech sound disjointed.
- **Database Size:** Concatenative systems require large databases of recorded speech to produce natural-sounding output. This can be limiting in terms of storage and processing requirements.
- **Contextual Variability:** Speech is highly variable depending on context, emotion, and speaker. Concatenative systems must account for these variables, which is especially challenging when synthesizing speech from a limited number of prerecorded units.

#### **f. Advanced Techniques in Speech Generation**
- **Unit Selection Synthesis:** This method selects the most appropriate units from a large database of recorded speech to minimize mismatches in pitch, timing, and spectral features. The goal is to create a natural-sounding output by carefully selecting units that match the target speech.
- **Deep Learning and Neural Networks:** Recent advancements in deep learning have led to the development of neural network-based speech synthesis systems, such as WaveNet and Tacotron. These systems can generate more natural-sounding speech by directly learning the mapping between text and audio, without relying on pre-recorded speech units.

---

#### **Summary of Key Concepts:**
1. **Speech Generation** involves converting text into spoken language, using either concatenative or parametric synthesis methods.
2. **Reproduced Speech Output** is the final speech that is generated and can be produced using methods like concatenative synthesis (using recorded speech units) or parametric synthesis (using mathematical models).
3. **Time-Dependent Sound Concatenation** refers to the alignment of sound segments based on timing and rhythm, which ensures smooth transitions between speech units.
4. **Frequency-Dependent Sound Concatenation** focuses on the spectral and frequency characteristics of speech, ensuring that the timbre and pitch of concatenated units are compatible to avoid unnatural artifacts.
5. **Challenges** in concatenative synthesis include achieving naturalness, handling contextual variability, and managing large databases of recorded speech.
6. **Advanced Techniques** like unit selection synthesis and deep learning models (WaveNet, Tacotron) are being used to improve speech generation and make it more natural and flexible.

### 2.5 Speech Transmission: Signal Form Coding, Source Coding in Parametrized Systems, Recognition, and Synthesis Systems

#### **a. Introduction to Speech Transmission**
Speech transmission involves the process of encoding, transmitting, and decoding speech signals across communication channels. The goal is to preserve the intelligibility, quality, and naturalness of speech while reducing the bandwidth required for transmission. Various techniques are used in speech transmission systems, including signal form coding, source coding, and synthesis methods, which optimize how speech is represented, transmitted, and reproduced.

---

#### **b. Signal Form Coding in Speech Transmission**
Signal form coding, also known as speech coding, refers to the process of converting the speech signal into a compressed or coded form suitable for transmission over a communication channel. The primary objective is to represent the speech signal in a compact format that requires less bandwidth while maintaining an acceptable level of intelligibility and quality.

##### **Key Concepts in Signal Form Coding:**
- **Speech Signal Representation:** The raw speech signal consists of complex acoustic patterns that need to be represented in a form that can be efficiently transmitted and decoded. Techniques such as **quantization** and **compression** are used to reduce the signal's redundancy and eliminate perceptually irrelevant details.
  
- **Time-Domain vs. Frequency-Domain Coding:**
  - **Time-Domain Coding:** This approach focuses on directly encoding the waveform of the speech signal in the time domain. Techniques like Pulse Code Modulation (PCM) are used here.
  - **Frequency-Domain Coding:** This approach transforms the speech signal into the frequency domain (typically using techniques like the Fourier Transform or the **Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT)**) to represent the speech in terms of frequency components. These components can be more easily compressed and transmitted.

- **Types of Speech Coders:**
  - **Linear Predictive Coding (LPC):** LPC models speech as a linear combination of past samples, focusing on the spectral envelope of speech. It is widely used for compression in speech coding, as it can efficiently represent speech with low bitrates.
  - **Subband Coding:** In this method, the speech signal is divided into multiple frequency bands (subbands), and each band is encoded independently. This allows for more efficient compression by exploiting the varying importance of different frequency ranges in the human ear's perception of speech.

- **Speech Compression Techniques:**
  - **Lossless Compression:** Techniques like Huffman coding and arithmetic coding are used when exact reproduction of the signal is needed. These methods reduce the size of the data without losing any information.
  - **Lossy Compression:** Techniques like **MP3** or **AAC** remove parts of the signal that are perceptually less important to human hearing (e.g., higher frequencies or redundant data) to reduce the bit rate, at the cost of some quality loss.

---

#### **c. Source Coding in Parametrized Systems**
Source coding is the process of converting the original speech signal (the source) into a coded representation for transmission. In the context of parametrized systems, source coding focuses on extracting and encoding relevant parameters from the speech signal, rather than transmitting the entire waveform.

##### **Key Elements of Source Coding in Parametrized Systems:**
- **Parametrization of Speech:**
  - **Linear Predictive Coefficients (LPC):** LPC is a popular method for parameterizing speech signals. It analyzes the speech signal over short periods (typically 20-40 ms) and models it as the output of a linear filter driven by an excitation signal (the residual). The LPC coefficients represent the spectral characteristics of the speech, and these coefficients are transmitted instead of the entire signal.
  - **Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs):** MFCCs are another widely used parameterization technique that models speech signals based on the human ear's logarithmic perception of frequency. MFCCs are used in speech recognition and synthesis, as they provide a compact and effective representation of speech.

- **Bitrate Reduction:** 
  - Parametrization allows for significant bitrate reduction by encoding only the parameters (such as LPC coefficients) that capture the essential features of the speech. This is important for low-bandwidth communication channels, such as mobile networks or VoIP (Voice over IP) services.
  
- **Predictive Models:**
  - Predictive models such as LPC and **autoregressive models** aim to predict future speech samples based on past samples. These models help in parameterizing the speech signal, enabling efficient coding while preserving important features of the speech, such as formants and pitch.

- **Quantization of Parameters:**
  - In source coding, the extracted parameters are often quantized to reduce the number of bits needed to represent them. This process involves approximating the continuous values of the parameters by discrete values, thereby reducing data size.

#### **e. Synthesis Systems (Speech Synthesis)**
Speech synthesis is the process of generating human-like speech from textual or parametric input. Synthesis systems aim to produce speech that is intelligible, natural-sounding, and expressive.

##### **Key Components of Speech Synthesis Systems:**
- **Text-to-Speech (TTS) Systems:** TTS systems are the most common form of speech synthesis. They take textual input (e.g., a sentence) and convert it into speech using various synthesis methods.
  
- **Synthesis Methods:**
  - **Concatenative Synthesis:** This method involves concatenating pre-recorded units of speech, such as phonemes or syllables, to form words and sentences. The advantage is natural-sounding speech, but it requires a large database of recordings.
  - **Formant Synthesis:** In this method, speech is generated by simulating the vocal tract's resonance properties (formants) using a model. It is more computationally efficient but can sound less natural.
  - **Articulatory Synthesis:** This method simulates the physical process of speech production, such as the movement of the vocal cords and articulators (tongue, lips). It is computationally intensive but can generate highly natural-sounding speech.

- **Parametric Synthesis:** In this approach, speech is generated using parameters such as pitch, duration, and spectral features (e.g., LPC coefficients). This allows for more flexible control over the generated speech, making it possible to modify speech characteristics (e.g., pitch or speed) more easily.

- **Neural Network-based Synthesis:** Recent advancements in **Deep Learning** have led to the development of neural network-based synthesis methods, such as **WaveNet** and **Tacotron**. These methods generate speech directly from text or parameters, producing highly natural and expressive speech.

- **Expressive Synthesis:** This involves adding emotional tone, prosody, and other expressive features to the generated speech. It aims to make synthetic speech sound more natural and lifelike, capable of expressing emotions like happiness, sadness, or anger.

---

#### **f. Conclusion**
In speech transmission, signal form coding and source coding are critical for efficiently representing and compressing speech signals for transmission over communication channels. Recognition systems convert speech into meaningful text or commands, while synthesis systems aim to generate natural-sounding speech from text or parameters. Both recognition and synthesis technologies are essential for a wide range of applications, including voice assistants, telecommunication, and accessibility tools. With ongoing advancements in machine learning and signal processing, speech transmission and synthesis technologies continue to improve in accuracy, efficiency, and expressiveness.
