### **Unit 3: Images and Graphics**  
#### **3.1 Digital Image Representation**  
A digital image is a numerical representation of a two-dimensional visual object. It is composed of individual elements called **pixels** (picture elements), each having a specific location and color value. 

---

#### **Key Concepts in Digital Image Representation**  

1. **Pixels**:  
   - The smallest unit of a digital image.  
   - Represented as points or squares arranged in a grid.  
   - Each pixel has an intensity value that determines its color or shade.  
   - Higher resolution images have more pixels, providing greater detail.

2. **Resolution**:  
   - Number of pixels in an image, usually specified as width × height (e.g., 1920 × 1080).  
   - Higher resolution means more detail but requires more storage space.  

3. **Color Models**:  
   - **Grayscale**: Images with shades of gray ranging from black (0) to white (255 for 8-bit images).  
   - **RGB (Red, Green, Blue)**: Most common model for colored images. Each pixel has three values (R, G, B).  
   - **CMYK (Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, Black)**: Used in printing.  
   - **YUV/YCrCb**: Used in video and TV broadcasting.  

4. **Bit Depth**:  
   - Determines the number of colors or shades per pixel.  
   - Example:
     - **1-bit**: Black and white only.  
     - **8-bit**: 256 shades of gray or colors.  
     - **24-bit**: Over 16 million colors (8 bits for each of RGB).

#### **Image Formats and Storage Formats**  

Digital images can be stored in various formats, depending on the required quality, compression, and intended application.

1. **Raster Formats** (Pixel-Based):  
   Store images as a grid of colored pixels.  
   - **Examples**:  
     - **BMP**: Uncompressed; large file size; used for simple storage.  
     - **JPEG**: Compressed format; supports lossy compression; commonly used in photography.  
     - **PNG**: Lossless compression; supports transparency.  
     - **GIF**: Supports animation; limited to 256 colors.  

   **Example: PNG vs. JPEG**
   ```text
   - PNG: Higher quality, larger file size, supports transparency.
   - JPEG: Compressed, smaller file size, no transparency support.
   ```

2. **Vector Formats** (Mathematical Representation):  
   Store images as geometric shapes, paths, and text rather than pixels.  
   - **Examples**:  
     - **SVG**: Scalable Vector Graphics, commonly used for web and UI design.  
     - **EPS**: Used in professional printing.  

3. **Hybrid Formats**:  
   Combine raster and vector data.  
   - **Example**: PDF (Portable Document Format).  

---

#### **Image Storage Formats**  

1. **Raw Formats**:  
   - Captures unprocessed image data from devices like cameras.  
   - Example: **RAW**, **DNG**.  

2. **Compressed Formats**:  
   Reduce file size by eliminating redundancy.  
   - **Lossy Compression**: Reduces quality but significantly decreases file size (e.g., JPEG).  
   - **Lossless Compression**: Maintains original quality (e.g., PNG, GIF).

3. **Application-Specific Formats**:  
   Designed for specific applications.  
   - Example: **TIFF** for printing and publishing.
