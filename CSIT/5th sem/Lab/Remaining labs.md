**Morphing Techniques, Audio and Video Editing Software, and Data Compression.**  

---

## **Lab 1: Morphing Techniques**  
**Objective:**  
To understand and implement morphing techniques for smooth transition effects between images.  

**Software Required:**  
- Adobe Photoshop (with Liquify tool)  
- MorphMan (dedicated morphing software)  
- GIMP (open-source alternative with morphing plugins)  

**Steps:**  
1. **Image Selection:**  
   - Choose two images of similar dimensions and features (e.g., two human faces).  
   
2. **Feature Alignment:**  
   - Use control points to align key facial features (eyes, nose, mouth) between the two images.  
   
3. **Morphing Process:**  
   - Load both images in the morphing tool.  
   - Define transition points (control vectors) between the images.  
   - Apply tweening to generate intermediate frames.  

4. **Exporting the Morph:**  
   - Export the morphed sequence as a GIF or video file.  
   
5. **Analysis and Evaluation:**  
   - Analyze smoothness and accuracy of transitions.  
   - Adjust control points for better results.  

**Expected Outcome:**  
A smoothly morphed animation that transitions between two images with minimal distortion.

## **Lab 2: Audio and Video Editing Software**  
**Objective:**  
To familiarize with professional audio and video editing tools and understand their features.  

**Software Required:**  
- **Audio Editing:** Audacity, Adobe Audition  
- **Video Editing:** Adobe Premiere Pro, Filmora, DaVinci Resolve  

**Steps:**  
### **A. Audio Editing Task**  
1. **Recording and Importing Audio:**  
   - Record an audio sample or import an existing one.  
   
2. **Basic Editing:**  
   - Cut, trim, and merge audio clips.  
   - Apply effects such as noise reduction, equalization, and normalization.  
   
3. **Adding Effects:**  
   - Experiment with reverb, echo, and pitch adjustments.  
   
4. **Exporting the Audio:**  
   - Save the edited file in MP3 and WAV formats.  

**Expected Outcome:**  
A well-edited audio file with improved clarity and added effects.

### **B. Video Editing Task**  
1. **Importing Video Clips:**  
   - Load video files into the timeline.  

2. **Basic Editing:**  
   - Cut, split, and merge video segments.  
   - Add transitions, text overlays, and background music.  

3. **Color Correction:**  
   - Adjust brightness, contrast, and saturation.  

4. **Rendering and Exporting:**  
   - Export the final video in MP4 and AVI formats.  

**Expected Outcome:**  
A polished video clip with transitions, effects, and optimized quality.

## **Lab 3: Data Compression**  
**Objective:**  
To understand and implement different data compression techniques for multimedia files.  

**Software Required:**  
- WinRAR/7-Zip (for file compression)  
- Audacity (for audio compression)  
- HandBrake (for video compression)  

**Steps:**  

### **A. Lossless Compression**  
1. **File Compression (ZIP/RAR):**  
   - Compress a multimedia file using ZIP and RAR formats.  
   - Compare compression ratios and file sizes.  

2. **Audio Compression (FLAC):**  
   - Convert WAV audio to FLAC (lossless compression).  
   - Analyze file size and audio quality.  

---

### **B. Lossy Compression**  
1. **Audio Compression (MP3):**  
   - Convert a WAV file to MP3 using different bitrates (128kbps, 256kbps).  
   - Observe quality loss and file size reduction.  

2. **Video Compression (H.264):**  
   - Convert a high-resolution video to a lower bitrate using HandBrake.  
   - Compare quality and compression ratio.  

---

**Expected Outcome:**  
Understanding the trade-off between file size and quality in different compression techniques.  

---

**Evaluation and Report Submission:**  
- Write a lab report including screenshots of each step.  
- Discuss observations on compression ratios, quality retention, and practical applications.
