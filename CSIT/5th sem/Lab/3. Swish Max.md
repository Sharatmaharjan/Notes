#### **1. Create a Simple Animated Text Banner**  
**Objective**: Animate text to move from left to right across the screen.  
**Expected Output**: A banner with your name animated across the screen.  
**Steps**:  
1. Open **Swish Max**.  
2. Insert a **text object** with your name.  
3. Apply a motion effect like "Slide in from left."  
4. Set the animation duration and preview it.  
5. Export the result as a SWF file.  

#### **2. Design a Flash Button with Hover Effects**  
**Objective**: Create an interactive button that changes color when hovered over.  
**Expected Output**: A button that changes from red to green when the mouse hovers over it.  
**Steps**:  
1. Insert a **shape object** and design a button.  
2. Add text (e.g., "Click Me").  
3. Use the **Action** panel to assign a mouse-over event.  
4. Change the color of the button during the event.  
5. Preview and export your project.  

#### **3. Create a Simple Animation with Multiple Objects**  
**Objective**: Animate two objects moving in opposite directions simultaneously.  
**Expected Output**: A circle moves left to right, and a rectangle moves right to left.  
**Steps**:  
1. Insert a **circle** and a **rectangle** into the workspace.  
2. Apply a "Slide" motion effect to both objects but in opposite directions.  
3. Set the animation duration to 5 seconds.  
4. Synchronize the animations using the timeline.  
5. Export the animation.  

#### **4. Create a Text Morphing Effect**  
**Objective**: Morph one word into another (e.g., "Hello" morphs into "World").  
**Expected Output**: A smooth transition between two words.  
**Steps**:  
1. Insert a **text object** with "Hello."  
2. Add another text object with "World."  
3. Apply the **Morph** effect between the two text objects.  
4. Adjust the effect settings for a smooth transition.  
5. Export the project.  

#### **5. Develop a Simple Interactive Quiz Interface**  
**Objective**: Create a quiz with a question, multiple-choice options, and feedback for the correct answer.  
**Expected Output**: A quiz that highlights the correct answer after a selection.  
**Steps**:  
1. Insert a **text object** for the question (e.g., "What is 2 + 2?").  
2. Add **three buttons** for the options (e.g., "3," "4," "5").  
3. Use the **Action** panel to assign a click event for each button.  
4. Display feedback ("Correct" or "Try Again") based on the selection.  
5. Preview the quiz and export it.
