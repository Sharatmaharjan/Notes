### Unit 4: Video and Animation  

#### 4.1. **Video Signal Representation**  
Video signals are the electronic representation of visual information, typically originating from a camera, which is processed and transmitted for display.  
- **Analog Video Signal**  
  - Composed of continuous waves representing brightness (luminance) and color (chrominance).  
  - Examples: NTSC, PAL, and SECAM standards.  
  - Bandwidth requirements depend on resolution and frame rate.  
- **Digital Video Signal**  
  - Discrete values represent video data, offering better compression and quality.  
  - Stored in formats like MPEG, AVI, and MP4.  
  - Sampling involves three primary steps: **sampling**, **quantization**, and **encoding**.  

#### a. **Visual Representation**  
The visual representation of a video involves the depiction of real-world scenes in frames:  
- **Frame Composition**  
  - A video is a sequence of frames displayed rapidly to simulate motion.  
  - Common frame rates: 24 fps (films), 30 fps (TV), 60 fps (high-definition).  
- **Pixels**  
  - Basic units of a digital image that form the frame.  
  - Pixel depth determines color richness (e.g., 24-bit for true color).  
- **Color Models**  
  - **RGB**: Red, Green, Blue for screens.  
  - **YUV**: Luminance (Y) and chrominance (UV) for video compression.  
  - **CMYK**: Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, Key for printing.  

#### b. **Transmission**  
Transmission involves sending video data over a medium for display or storage:  
- **Analog Transmission**  
  - Requires modulation of video signals (e.g., Amplitude Modulation or Frequency Modulation).  
  - Prone to degradation and noise.  
- **Digital Transmission**  
  - Encodes video into binary data for robust transfer.  
  - Common protocols: TCP/IP for internet-based video, HDMI for wired transmission.  
- **Streaming**  
  - Real-time transmission over networks.  
  - Types: Live (real-time) and On-demand (pre-recorded).  
  - Uses compression standards like H.264 or H.265.  

#### c. **Digitalization**  
Digitalization converts analog video signals into digital formats, enabling efficient storage, transmission, and processing.  
- **Steps in Digitalization**  
  1. **Sampling**: Captures specific intervals of the analog signal.  
  2. **Quantization**: Assigns numeric values to sampled points.  
  3. **Encoding**: Converts numeric values into binary code.  
- **Benefits of Digitalization**  
  - Higher quality and resolution.  
  - Easy editing and manipulation.  
  - Compatibility with modern storage and transmission systems.
