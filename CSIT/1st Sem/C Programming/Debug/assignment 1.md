Here are 10 different and interesting C programming questions that incorporate control structures and 1-D arrays:

### Control Structures:
1. **Prime Number Finder:**  
   Write a program to find and print all the prime numbers between 1 and 100. Use a `for` loop and `if` condition to implement the logic.

2. **Guess the Number Game:**  
   Write a program where the computer selects a random number between 1 and 50, and the user has to guess it. Provide hints like "Too High" or "Too Low" using `if-else`.

3. **Menu-Driven Calculator:**  
   Implement a menu-driven calculator using a `switch` statement. The user can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division of two numbers based on their choice.

4. **Pattern Printing:**  
   Write a program to print the following pattern using nested `for` loops:  
   ```
   *
   **
   ***
   ****
   *****
   ```

5. **Leap Year Checker:**  
   Write a program to check if a given year is a leap year or not using `if-else` and print the result.

### 1-D Arrays:
6. **Maximum and Minimum Finder:**  
   Write a program that takes `n` numbers as input into an array and finds the maximum and minimum numbers in the array.

7. **Reverse Array Elements:**  
   Write a program to reverse the elements of a 1-D array and print the reversed array.

8. **Frequency Counter:**  
   Write a program to count the frequency of a given number in a 1-D array. For example, if the array is `{1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 2}` and the number is `2`, the output should be `3`.

9. **Bubble Sort Implementation:**  
   Implement the Bubble Sort algorithm to sort a 1-D array of integers in ascending order.

10. **Sum of Even Numbers:**  
    Write a program to calculate and print the sum of all even numbers in a 1-D array.
