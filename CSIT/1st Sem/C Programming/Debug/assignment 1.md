### Control Structures:

1. **Guess the Number Game:**  
   Write a program where the computer selects a random number between 1 and 50, and the user has to guess it. Provide hints like "Too High" or "Too Low" using `if-else`.

2. **Pattern Printing:**  
Write a C program to print a **diamond-shaped pyramid pattern** using nested `for` loops. The program should take an integer `n` as input, which represents the number of rows in the upper half of the diamond. Your task is to create a diamond shape where:
- The top part is a pyramid of stars (`*`).
- The bottom part is an inverted pyramid of stars (`*`).
  
#### Example:
For `n = 5`, the output should be:

```
    *
   ***
  *****
 *******
*********
 *******
  *****
   ***
    *
```

### 1-D Arrays:
3. **Maximum and Minimum Finder:**  
   Write a program that takes `n` numbers as input into an array and finds the maximum and minimum numbers in the array.

4. **Reverse Array Elements:**  
   Write a program to reverse the elements of a 1-D array and print the reversed array.

5. **Frequency Counter:**  
   Write a program to count the frequency of a given number in a 1-D array. For example, if the array is `{1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 2}` and the number is `2`, the output should be `3`.

6. **Sum of Even Numbers:**  
    Write a program to calculate and print the sum of all even numbers in a 1-D array.
