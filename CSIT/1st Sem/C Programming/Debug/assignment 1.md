### Control Structures:

1. **Guess the Number Game:**  
   Write a program where the computer selects a random number between 1 and 50, and the user has to guess it. Provide hints like "Too High" or "Too Low" using `if-else`.

2. **Pattern Printing:**  
   Write a program to print the following pattern using nested `for` loops:  
   
    *
   ***
  *****
 *******
*********


---

### 1-D Arrays:
3. **Maximum and Minimum Finder:**  
   Write a program that takes `n` numbers as input into an array and finds the maximum and minimum numbers in the array.

4. **Reverse Array Elements:**  
   Write a program to reverse the elements of a 1-D array and print the reversed array.

5. **Frequency Counter:**  
   Write a program to count the frequency of a given number in a 1-D array. For example, if the array is `{1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 2}` and the number is `2`, the output should be `3`.

6. **Sum of Even Numbers:**  
    Write a program to calculate and print the sum of all even numbers in a 1-D array.
