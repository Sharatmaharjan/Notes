To solve the questions related to Riley Company's cost of equity and weighted average cost of capital (WACC), we need to follow these steps:

### i. Cost of Equity for 2012

The cost of equity can be calculated using the Dividend Discount Model (DDM) or the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM). Given the information, we can use the Dividend Discount Model:

\[ \text{Cost of Equity} (K_e) = \frac{\text{Dividend per Share}}{\text{Current Market Price per Share}} + \text{Growth Rate} \]

Given:
- Dividend Yield = 6%
- Growth Rate = 8%
- Current Market Price per Share = Rs. 120

First, calculate the Dividend per Share:
\[ \text{Dividend per Share} = \text{Dividend Yield} \times \text{Current Market Price per Share} \]
\[ \text{Dividend per Share} = 0.06 \times 120 = Rs. 7.2 \]

Now, calculate the Cost of Equity:
\[ K_e = \frac{7.2}{120} + 0.08 = 0.06 + 0.08 = 0.14 \text{ or } 14\% \]

### ii. Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) when Rs. 50 million is raised

To calculate WACC, we need to consider the cost of each component of capital and their respective weights. The formula for WACC is:

\[ \text{WACC} = (W_d \times K_d \times (1 - T)) + (W_{ps} \times K_{ps}) + (W_e \times K_e) \]

Where:
- \( W_d \) = Weight of Debt
- \( K_d \) = Cost of Debt
- \( T \) = Tax Rate
- \( W_{ps} \) = Weight of Preferred Stock
- \( K_{ps} \) = Cost of Preferred Stock
- \( W_e \) = Weight of Equity
- \( K_e \) = Cost of Equity

Given:
- Total Assets = Rs. 200 million
- Additional Funds Needed = Rs. 50 million
- Cost of Debt (\( K_d \)) = 12%
- Cost of Preferred Stock (\( K_{ps} \)) = 11%
- Cost of Equity (\( K_e \)) = 14%
- Tax Rate (\( T \)) = 30%

First, determine the weights of each component in the capital structure:

1. **Debt:**
   - Existing Debt = Rs. 80 million
   - New Debt = Rs. 50 million (assuming all new funds are raised through debt)
   - Total Debt = Rs. 80 million + Rs. 50 million = Rs. 130 million
   - Weight of Debt (\( W_d \)) = \( \frac{130}{200 + 50} = \frac{130}{250} = 0.52 \)

2. **Preferred Stock:**
   - Existing Preferred Stock = Rs. 20 million
   - Weight of Preferred Stock (\( W_{ps} \)) = \( \frac{20}{250} = 0.08 \)

3. **Equity:**
   - Existing Equity = Rs. 100 million
   - Weight of Equity (\( W_e \)) = \( \frac{100}{250} = 0.40 \)

Now, calculate WACC:
\[ \text{WACC} = (0.52 \times 0.12 \times (1 - 0.30)) + (0.08 \times 0.11) + (0.40 \times 0.14) \]
\[ \text{WACC} = (0.52 \times 0.12 \times 0.70) + (0.08 \times 0.11) + (0.40 \times 0.14) \]
\[ \text{WACC} = (0.52 \times 0.084) + 0.0088 + 0.056 \]
\[ \text{WACC} = 0.04368 + 0.0088 + 0.056 \]
\[ \text{WACC} = 0.10848 \text{ or } 10.848\% \]

### Summary:
- **Cost of Equity for 2012:** 14%
- **Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC):** 10.848%
