# AVL Tree

1. Construct an AVL tree by inserting the following keys in the given order:
   **30, 20, 10, 25, 40, 50**
   Show the AVL tree after each insertion and indicate the rotation(s) performed.

2. Insert the elements **10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 25** into an empty AVL tree.
   Identify the imbalance case at each step and perform the required rotations to obtain the final AVL tree.

3. Construct an AVL tree for the following sequence of keys:
   **50, 30, 70, 20, 40, 60, 80, 10**
   Calculate the balance factor of each node after all insertions.

4. Construct an AVL tree by inserting the keys:
   **45, 30, 60, 20, 35, 50, 70, 10**
   Clearly show all intermediate trees and the rotations applied.

5. Insert the following elements into an empty AVL tree:
   **16, 27, 9, 11, 36, 54, 81**
   Identify the first unbalanced node and perform the appropriate rotation to balance the tree.

6. Construct an AVL tree by inserting the keys:
   **33, 26, 43, 40, 57, 11, 13, 31, 63, 10**
   Clearly show all intermediate trees and the rotations applied.

# B-Tree

1. Construct a **B-Tree of order 3** by inserting the following keys in the given order:
   **10, 20, 5, 6, 12, 30, 7, 17**
   Show the B-Tree after each insertion and indicate all node splits.

2. Insert the keys **1, 3, 7, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 18, 16, 19, 24, 25, 26, 21, 4, 5** into an empty **B-Tree of order 4**.
   Draw the final B-Tree and explain the splitting process.

3. Construct a **B-Tree of minimum degree t = 2** by inserting the following elements:
   **8, 9, 10, 11, 15, 20, 17**
   Show how the tree grows after each insertion.

4. Insert the following keys into an empty **B-Tree of order 5**:
   **20, 10, 30, 5, 15, 25, 35, 40**
   Show all intermediate B-Tree structures and node splits.

5. Construct a **B-Tree of order 3** using the following insertion sequence:
   **50, 40, 60, 30, 45, 55, 70, 20**
   Clearly show root splitting and redistribution steps.
