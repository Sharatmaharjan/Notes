## 1. As a network administrator of your college, you are required to upgrade your college network, explain the factors you consider while designing the network.[10marks]

As a network administrator upgrading the college network, it is essential to follow a systematic approach to design a network that meets current demands and supports future growth. The key factors to consider are:

#### 1. **Requirement Analysis and Objectives**

Before starting the design, collect detailed information about:

* **Number of users, devices, and applications** (students, faculty, staff, labs, library systems, etc.).
* **Type of traffic** (video conferencing, VoIP, e-learning portals, cloud applications).
* **Peak usage times** and expected growth rate.
  This helps determine network size, performance needs, and future scalability.

---

#### 2. **Scalability and Flexibility**

* The network should support future expansion without requiring major redesigns.
* Choose **modular devices** (stackable switches, scalable routers) and consider IPv6 addressing for long-term growth.
* Include sufficient IP address planning and subnetting to handle device growth.

---

#### 3. **Network Topology Design**

* Use a **hierarchical network model** (core, distribution, access layers) for better performance and easy management.
* Implement **redundant links and paths** to avoid single points of failure.
* A **hybrid topology** combining wired (for stability) and wireless (for mobility) is suitable for college environments.

---

#### 4. **Performance and Bandwidth Planning**

* Estimate total bandwidth required for academic activities, online classes, multimedia, and administrative tasks.
* Provide **dedicated backbone links** (fiber optic connections) between buildings.
* Implement **Quality of Service (QoS)** to prioritize latency-sensitive services like VoIP or exam servers.

---

#### 5. **Security Considerations**

* Deploy **firewalls, intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS)**, and secure access controls.
* Use **network segmentation** (VLANs) to isolate traffic (student, faculty, guest).
* Implement **data encryption** (VPN for remote access) and enforce strong authentication policies.

---

#### 6. **Reliability and Redundancy**

* Install **backup power supplies (UPS, generators)** to ensure uptime.
* Configure **link aggregation and failover mechanisms** to minimize downtime during hardware or link failures.
* Regular backups of configurations and disaster recovery planning are essential.

---

#### 7. **Hardware and Cabling Infrastructure**

* Choose **enterprise-grade routers, switches, and servers** with high throughput and PoE (Power over Ethernet) support for APs.
* Use **Cat6/Cat6a cables for horizontal wiring** and **fiber optics for backbone connections** to support high speeds.
* Plan structured cabling layouts to make future troubleshooting easier.

---

#### 8. **Wireless Network Planning**

* Deploy **Wi-Fi 6/6E access points** to handle dense user environments such as classrooms and libraries.
* Perform a **wireless site survey** to ensure proper coverage and avoid dead zones.
* Enable a **Guest Wi-Fi network** for visitors, separate from internal traffic.

---

#### 9. **Cost, Budget, and Resource Allocation**

* Create a cost-effective plan by balancing performance needs and budget constraints.
* Consider **leasing hardware, using cloud services**, and adopting open-source network management solutions.
* Plan for **training IT staff** for long-term maintenance.

---

#### 10. **Standards, Compliance, and Documentation**

* Follow **IEEE standards (802.3, 802.11)** and best practices to ensure compatibility.
* Comply with data protection regulations and institutional IT policies.
* Maintain **detailed documentation** of network diagrams, device configurations, and addressing schemes.

## 2. You have been appointed as the Network Manager of the newly opened department store, which does not have a computer network. As a Network Manager your job is to setup a network. The department store have three floor. With the given requirement, design a effective network by mentioning different networking devices you will use with its purpose.[10marks]

---

As the Network Manager for the new three-floor department store, I would design an effective **Local Area Network (LAN)** that ensures **connectivity, security, scalability, and centralized management**. Below is the proposed design and networking devices with their purposes:


#### **1. Network Topology Design**

* Adopt a **Hierarchical Star Topology**:

  * **Core Layer:** Main router and core switch in the server room.
  * **Distribution Layer:** Floor-wise distribution switches to manage each floor.
  * **Access Layer:** End devices (PCs, POS systems, printers, IP cameras) connected to access switches.
* Use **Fiber Optic backbone cabling** between floors for high-speed connectivity, and Cat6 cables for device connections.
