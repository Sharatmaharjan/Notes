### **Lesson Plan**  

**Unit 1 (3 hours): Introduction to Data Communications**  
Topics include network components & types, OSI vs TCP/IP models, network standards, and future trends (IoT, BYOD). Pedagogy will involve lectures and a Smart Cities case study. Assessment includes a group discussion comparing OSI/TCP/IP models. Remarks: Use Packet Tracer for demonstration.

**Unit 2 (4 hours): Application Layer**  
Covers client-server architectures, HTTP/SMTP/MIME, and cloud computing. Activities include Wireshark demonstrations. Students will present "How Zoom uses UDP". Remarks: IT admin guest speaker will participate.

**Unit 3 (7 hours): Physical Layer**  
Focuses on transmission media, modulation/multiplexing, and VoIP. Lab activity: building Ethernet cables. Assessment requires a "5G vs Fiber" report. Remarks: RJ45 tools will be needed.

**Unit 4 (5 hours): Data Link Layer**  
Examines MAC protocols, error detection, and synchronous transmission. Uses Packet Tracer simulations. Assessment includes a quiz on CRC problems.

**Unit 5 (7 hours): Network/Transport Layers**  
Covers TCP vs UDP, IP subnetting, and routing protocols. Features subnetting workshops. Project involves campus subnet design. Remarks: Cisco CLI required.

**Unit 6 (6 hours): Wired/Wireless LANs**  
Studies Ethernet/Wi-Fi standards, VLANs & security, and performance tuning. Hackathon activity: securing Wi-Fi. Case study on SOHO design.

**Unit 7 (4 hours): Backbone Networks**  
Explores switched/routed backbones and VLAN implementation. Lab work on switch configuration. Assessment: VLAN configuration lab. Remarks: Switch hardware needed.

**Unit 8 (4 hours): Wide Area Networks**  
Examines T-carrier/SONET and VPNs/MPLS. AWS VPN lab activity. Assessment includes reflection on VPN uses.

**Unit 9 (2 hours): The Internet**  
Covers ISP architectures, access technologies, and governance. Features net neutrality debate. Assessment: internet backbone infographic (group work).

**Unit 10 (6 hours): Network Design**  
Focuses on needs analysis, SNMP monitoring, and cost management. Role-play activity: IT support scenarios. Final project: college network proposal. Remarks: IT manager will be invited.
