### 2.9 Basic Concepts of Network Architecture: Client-Server and Peer-to-Peer

Network architecture defines how network components are structured and how they interact. Two fundamental architectures are Client-Server and Peer-to-Peer (P2P).

### 1. Client-Server Architecture

**Definition:**
- Client-Server architecture is a network model where resources and services are managed by dedicated servers, and clients access these resources and services over the network.

**Key Characteristics:**

- **Roles:**
  - **Server:** A centralized system that provides resources, services, or data to clients. Servers manage and control access to resources, handle requests, and provide responses.
  - **Client:** An end-user device or application that requests resources or services from the server. Clients use these resources but do not provide them.

- **Centralization:**
  - Servers are centralized, meaning that they handle most of the processing, data storage, and management functions. This centralization helps in maintaining, securing, and backing up data.

- **Communication:**
  - Clients send requests to servers, which process these requests and send back the appropriate responses. Communication typically follows a request-response model.

**Examples:**
- **Web Services:** A web server hosting websites and clients accessing these websites through web browsers.
- **Email Systems:** An email server managing and storing emails, while clients (email applications) retrieve and send emails.

**Advantages:**
- **Centralized Management:** Easier to manage, secure, and back up data from a central location.
- **Scalability:** Servers can be upgraded or replaced to handle increased load, allowing for scalability.
- **Resource Sharing:** Efficient sharing of resources like files, printers, and databases.

**Disadvantages:**
- **Single Point of Failure:** If the server fails, clients cannot access the resources or services.
- **Cost:** Higher cost for server hardware, software, and maintenance.
- **Scalability Issues:** High load on servers can lead to performance issues if not properly managed.

### 2. Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Architecture

**Definition:**
- Peer-to-Peer (P2P) architecture is a decentralized network model where each node (peer) can act as both a client and a server. Peers directly share resources and data with each other without relying on a central server.

**Key Characteristics:**

- **Roles:**
  - **Peer:** Any device or node in the network that can both provide and consume resources. Each peer can serve requests from other peers and can also make requests to other peers.

- **Decentralization:**
  - There is no central server managing the network. Instead, all peers contribute equally to resource sharing and data distribution.

- **Communication:**
  - Peers communicate directly with each other. Each peer can initiate or respond to requests, making the system more resilient and distributed.

**Examples:**
- **File Sharing Networks:** Systems like BitTorrent where users share files directly with each other.
- **VoIP Applications:** Applications like Skype that allow users to communicate directly without a central server.

**Advantages:**
- **Resilience:** The network can continue to function even if some peers fail, as there is no central point of failure.
- **Cost:** Lower cost since there is no need for expensive server infrastructure.
- **Scalability:** Easy to scale as new peers can join the network and contribute resources.

**Disadvantages:**
- **Security:** Harder to manage and secure, as each peer can potentially be a point of vulnerability.
- **Management:** Difficult to manage and monitor as there is no central control.
- **Performance:** Can suffer from inconsistencies in performance due to varying peer capabilities and network conditions.

### Comparison of Client-Server and Peer-to-Peer Architectures

| Feature               | Client-Server Architecture                          | Peer-to-Peer Architecture                     |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **Centralization**    | Centralized (server manages resources)              | Decentralized (peers manage resources)        |
| **Roles**             | Distinct roles (client requests, server provides)   | Equal roles (peers both request and provide)  |
| **Management**        | Centralized management, easier to control            | Distributed management, harder to control      |
| **Scalability**       | Scalable with server upgrades, but can be a bottleneck| Scalable as more peers join, no central bottleneck |
| **Resilience**        | Single point of failure (server)                     | More resilient to failures (distributed)      |
| **Cost**              | Higher cost (server infrastructure)                  | Lower cost (no central server required)       |
| **Security**          | Easier to secure centralized server                   | Harder to secure due to lack of central control|

### Summary

- **Client-Server Architecture:** Centralized model with dedicated servers providing resources to client devices. Offers centralized management, high security, and efficient resource sharing but can be costly and prone to single points of failure.
- **Peer-to-Peer Architecture:** Decentralized model where all peers share resources equally. Offers resilience and lower costs but can be challenging to manage and secure, with variable performance.

### 2.13 Network Topologies: Bus, Ring, and Star

Network topologies define the arrangement of devices and connections in a network. The choice of topology impacts the network's performance, scalability, and reliability. Here’s a detailed overview of three common network topologies: **Bus**, **Ring**, and **Star**.

### 1. Bus Topology

**Definition:**
- In a **Bus Topology**, all devices are connected to a single central cable, called the bus or backbone. Data sent by any device travels along the bus to reach all other devices.

**Key Features:**
- **Single Central Cable:** All devices are connected to a single cable.
- **Terminating Resistors:** Both ends of the bus cable must be terminated with resistors to prevent signal reflection and data collisions.
- **Data Transmission:** Data is sent in one direction (or bidirectional in some implementations) along the bus, and all devices receive the data, but only the intended recipient processes it.

**Advantages:**
- **Easy to Install:** Simple and cost-effective to set up, especially for small networks.
- **Flexible:** Adding or removing devices is relatively simple and doesn’t require major changes to the network.

**Disadvantages:**
- **Limited Length and Speed:** The length of the bus and the number of devices that can be connected are limited, which can impact performance.
- **Single Point of Failure:** If the central bus fails, the entire network becomes inoperable.
- **Collision:** Data collisions can occur when multiple devices attempt to send data simultaneously, leading to network congestion and reduced performance.

**Example:**
- Traditional Ethernet networks (10Base-2, 10Base-5) used a bus topology.

### 2. Ring Topology

**Definition:**
- In a **Ring Topology**, each device is connected to exactly two other devices, forming a circular data path. Data travels in one direction (unidirectional) or both directions (bidirectional) around the ring.

**Key Features:**
- **Circular Path:** Devices are connected in a closed loop, with each device having exactly two neighbors.
- **Data Transmission:** Data travels around the ring in a specific direction until it reaches the intended recipient.
- **Token Passing (for Bidirectional Rings):** In a bidirectional ring, a token (a small data packet) is passed around the network. A device must possess the token to send data, which helps avoid collisions.

**Advantages:**
- **Deterministic Data Transfer:** Data collisions are avoided, and the network can be more predictable in terms of performance.
- **Equal Access:** All devices have equal access to the network, and data is transmitted in an orderly manner.

**Disadvantages:**
- **Single Point of Failure:** If one device or connection fails, it can disrupt the entire network unless there is a redundancy mechanism (like dual rings).
- **Complex Configuration:** More complex to install and configure compared to bus topology.

**Example:**
- Token Ring networks, commonly used in older LAN environments, utilized a ring topology.

### 3. Star Topology

**Definition:**
- In a **Star Topology**, all devices are connected to a central hub or switch. Each device has a dedicated connection to the central device, which manages data traffic between devices.

**Key Features:**
- **Central Hub/Switch:** All data passes through a central device (hub or switch) that routes data to the appropriate device.
- **Dedicated Connections:** Each device has a dedicated connection to the central hub, which helps in reducing data collisions and improving performance.

**Advantages:**
- **Easy to Manage:** Troubleshooting and network management are easier since each device connects directly to the central hub.
- **Scalability:** New devices can be added or removed without disrupting the network.
- **Fault Isolation:** A failure in one cable or device does not affect the rest of the network.

**Disadvantages:**
- **Central Point of Failure:** If the central hub or switch fails, the entire network becomes inoperable.
- **Higher Cost:** Requires more cables and networking hardware (central hub or switch), which can increase installation costs.

**Example:**
- Modern Ethernet networks commonly use a star topology, where devices connect to a network switch or hub.

### 2.14 Basic Concept of OSI Reference Model

The **OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) Reference Model** is a conceptual framework used to understand and design network communication protocols and systems. It divides the communication process into seven distinct layers, each with specific functions and responsibilities. This model helps standardize and ensure interoperability between different network systems and technologies.


### 1. OSI Model Overview

The OSI model is organized into seven layers, each representing a specific aspect of network communication. The layers are listed from the lowest (physical) to the highest (application):

1. **Physical Layer**
2. **Data Link Layer**
3. **Network Layer**
4. **Transport Layer**
5. **Session Layer**
6. **Presentation Layer**

### 2.15 Internet Protocol Addressing

**Internet Protocol (IP) Addressing** is a critical aspect of networking that provides a way to identify and locate devices on a network. IP addresses are used to route data packets across networks, ensuring that they reach the correct destination. 

### 1. What is an IP Address?

An **IP address** is a unique numerical label assigned to each device connected to a network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication. It serves two primary functions:

- **Identification:** Identifies the host or network interface.
- **Location Addressing:** Provides the location of the device on the network, enabling data to be routed to it.

### 2. Types of IP Addresses

**1. IPv4 (Internet Protocol Version 4)**
- **Format:** IPv4 addresses are 32-bit numerical values, typically written in decimal format as four octets separated by periods (e.g., `192.168.1.1`).
- **Address Space:** IPv4 provides approximately 4.3 billion unique addresses.
- **Notation:** Uses dotted decimal notation (e.g., `192.168.0.1`).

**2. IPv6 (Internet Protocol Version 6)**
- **Format:** IPv6 addresses are 128-bit numerical values, written in hexadecimal format as eight groups of four hexadecimal digits separated by colons (e.g., `2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334`).
- **Address Space:** IPv6 provides a vastly larger address space, approximately 3.4 x 10^38 unique addresses.
- **Notation:** Uses hexadecimal notation with colons and can be abbreviated using zero compression (e.g., `2001:db8::1`).

### 3. IP Address Classes (IPv4)

IPv4 addresses are categorized into several classes, each designed for different types of networks:

- **Class A:**
  - **Range:** `1.0.0.0` to `126.0.0.0`
  - **Default Subnet Mask:** `255.0.0.0`
  - **Network Bits:** 8 bits
  - **Host Bits:** 24 bits
  - **Number of Networks:** 128
  - **Number of Hosts per Network:** Approximately 16 million

- **Class B:**
  - **Range:** `128.0.0.0` to `191.255.0.0`
  - **Default Subnet Mask:** `255.255.0.0`
  - **Network Bits:** 16 bits
  - **Host Bits:** 16 bits
  - **Number of Networks:** 16,384
  - **Number of Hosts per Network:** Approximately 65,000

- **Class C:**
  - **Range:** `192.0.0.0` to `223.255.255.0`
  - **Default Subnet Mask:** `255.255.255.0`
  - **Network Bits:** 24 bits
  - **Host Bits:** 8 bits
  - **Number of Networks:** 2 million
  - **Number of Hosts per Network:** 254

- **Class D (Multicast):**
  - **Range:** `224.0.0.0` to `239.255.255.255`
  - **Purpose:** Used for multicast groups

- **Class E (Experimental):**
  - **Range:** `240.0.0.0` to `255.255.255.255`
  - **Purpose:** Reserved for experimental use

### 4. Special IP Addresses

- **Loopback Address:** `127.0.0.1` (IPv4) or `::1` (IPv6)
  - **Purpose:** Used for testing and troubleshooting network applications on the local device.
  
- **Private IP Addresses (IPv4):** Reserved for use within private networks and not routable on the public internet.
  - **Ranges:**
    - **Class A:** `10.0.0.0` to `10.255.255.255`
    - **Class B:** `172.16.0.0` to `172.31.255.255`
    - **Class C:** `192.168.0.0` to `192.168.255.255`

- **Public IP Addresses:** Addresses assigned by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) and are routable on the public internet.

### 5. Subnetting

**Subnetting** is the process of dividing a large network into smaller, more manageable sub-networks (subnets). It improves network organization and security.

- **Subnet Mask:** Defines the boundary between the network portion and the host portion of an IP address.
  - **Example:** For a network with a subnet mask of `255.255.255.0`, the first three octets represent the network address, and the last octet represents the host address.

- **CIDR Notation:** Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) notation is used to specify IP addresses and their associated routing prefix. It is written as an IP address followed by a slash and the number of bits in the subnet mask (e.g., `192.168.1.0/24`).

### 6. IP Address Allocation

- **Dynamic IP Addressing:** IP addresses are assigned dynamically by a server (e.g., DHCP server) from a pool of available addresses.
- **Static IP Addressing:** IP addresses are manually assigned and do not change unless manually reconfigured.

### 7. Network Address Translation (NAT)

**NAT** is a technique used to map multiple private IP addresses to a single public IP address. It helps conserve public IP addresses and improves network security.

- **Types of NAT:**
  - **Static NAT:** Maps a single private IP address to a single public IP address.
  - **Dynamic NAT:** Maps private IP addresses to a pool of public IP addresses.
  - **PAT (Port Address Translation):** Also known as NAT overload, maps multiple private IP addresses to a single public IP address using different port numbers.

### Summary of IP Addressing
