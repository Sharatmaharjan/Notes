### **Section A** (Attempt any two questions)

**1.** Define structure and nested structure. Write a program to find out whether the nth term of the Fibonacci series is a prime number or not. Read the value of n from the user and display the result in the main function. Use separate user-defined functions to generate the nth Fibonacci term and to check whether that number is prime or not.

**2.** Explain the relation between array and pointer. Differentiate between call by value and call by reference with a suitable program.

**3.** Differentiate between source code and object code. Create a structure named Book with members Book_Name, Price, and Author_Name. Then take input for 10 records of Book and print the name of authors having the price of the book greater than 1000.

### **Section B** (Attempt any eight questions)

**4.** Describe the different types of I/O functions used in file handling with syntax.

**5.** Write a program to read a P*Q matrix of integers and find the largest integer of each row and display it.

**6.** Write a program to calculate the factorial of a given number using recursion.

**7.** Write a program to check whether the entered word is a palindrome or not.

**8.** List different types of operators and explain any three of them.

**9.** Trace the output:

```c
#include<conio.h>
#include<stdio.h>

void main(){
    int i = 0, k;
    for(k = 5; k >= 0; k--){
        i = i + k;
    }
    printf("%d\t", i);
    getch();
}
```

**10.** Write a program to compute the sum of the first 10 even numbers using a function.

**11.** What is dynamic memory allocation? Explain with a suitable program.

**12.** Write a program to initialize an array of dimension 10 and sort the numbers within the array in ascending order.
